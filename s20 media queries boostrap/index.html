                    During the British Raj in 1920, Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine
                    visit a
                    forest
                    in Adilabad, where
                    they abduct Malli, an artistically talented young girl from the Gond tribe. The tribe's guardian
                    Komaram
                    Bheem
                    embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. The Nizamate of
                    Hyderabad,
                    sympathetic to the Raj, warns Buxton's office of the impending danger and advises them to return
                    the
                    child.
                    Undeterred, Catherine enlists A. Rama Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer, to
                    quell
                    the
                    threat,
                    promising a promotion should he capture Bheem alive.

                    Raju and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend a pro-independence gathering in disguise, where Bheem's
                    aide Lachhu
                    attempts to recruit them into Bheem's plot. On the way to Bheem's hideout, Lachhu discerns
                    Raju's
                    identity
                    and
                    flees. Shortly afterward, Raju and Bheem witness a child getting trapped by a train wreck and
                    work
                    together
                    to
                    rescue him. Unaware of their opposing allegiances, they form a close friendship.<br><br>

                    With Raju's help, Bheem courts an Englishwoman named Jenny, discovering that she is
                    staying with the Buxtons.
                    Following a party where Raju and Bheem out-dance the pompous English attendees, Jenny invites
                    Bheem
                    to her
                    residence, where he finds Malli and promises to free her soon.

                    Meanwhile, Raju locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu sets a
                    banded
                    krait onto
                    Raju and warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds. Bheem
                    finds Raju,
                    saves his life, and divulges his tribal identity and mission, unaware of Raju's true identity.
                    That
                    night,
                    at an
                    event to honour Governor Buxton, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a lorry filled with
                    wild
                    animals,
                    creating havoc among the guests. Raju arrives and fights Bheem; Bheem is forced to stand down
                    when
                    Buxton
                    holds
                    Malli at gunpoint. Bheem is arrested and Raju is promoted.<br><br>A flashback reveals that
                    Raju's
                    father Alluri Venkatarama Raju was a revolutionary who hoped
                    to arm his
                    village
                    with British rifles but was killed by British soldiers before he got the chance. Raju
                    subsequently
                    left his
                    village and his fiancee Sita to become a mole within the police, his promotion for having
                    captured
                    Bheem
                    finally
                    giving him access to the gun shipments.

                    At Bheem's public flogging, Raju attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses
                    flogging
                    instead.
                    Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion, and
                    further
                    enlightening
                    Raju. He persuades Buxton to execute Bheem in secrecy in front of Malli while preparing an
                    ambush to
                    rescue
                    both
                    of them, but Buxton discovers the plan, and Raju is injured while rescuing Malli. Bheem,
                    thinking
                    Malli is
                    in
                    danger, bludgeons Raju and escapes with the girl. Raju is arrested for treason and imprisoned in
                    solitary
                    confinement.<br><br>Months later, Bheem, who is hiding with his group and Malli in Hathras, is
                    cornered by the
                    colonial
                    authorities.
                    He narrowly avoids being exposed when Sita repels them by claiming there is a smallpox epidemic.
                    Unaware of
                    Bheem's identity, she reveals Raju's anti-colonial objectives and his impending execution.
                    Realising
                    his
                    folly,
                    Bheem vows to save him.

                    With Jenny's sympathetic assistance, Bheem infiltrates the barracks where Raju is detained and
                    frees
                    him.
                    The
                    pair retreat to a nearby forest, where they defeat soldiers with a longbow taken from a Rama
                    shrine
                    and a
                    spear.
                    Taking the fight to Buxton, they hurl a flaming motorcycle into the barracks' magazines, setting
                    it
                    afire.
                    Bheem
                    steals a cache of guns for Raju before the barracks explode, killing many soldiers and
                    Catherine.
                    Cornering
                    a
                    wounded Buxton, Raju has Bheem execute him with a British rifle, fulfilling their respective
                    objectives.
                    Raju is
                    reunited with Sita, and Bheem is reunited with his tribe. To mark the mission's successful
                    completion, Raju
                    asks
                    Bheem to make a wish he can grant; Bheem asks Raju to provide education for him and his
                    community.
